  In this image are my 3 young adult children. This was two Mother's Day ago. I've always wanted to make sure I can show them that the blows of life can been soften so they could get through them.  This was the conversation we had right before taking this picture. We had laughed a lot that day. 

  # Week 1 Homework and Goals

1. **The Command Line Interface (CLI) is the way a developer navigates through a computer's file structure.**
1.*** Version Control with `git`

To help us maintain, back up, and share our codebases, we're going to use `git` (the command-line tool) and GitHub (the online repository). These tools are fundamental parts of the web developer's workflow, and you'll be using them _every day_ for the rest of your programming career!

1. **[Git](https://git-scm.com/doc) is a Source Control Management program that tracks file changes for you.**
**[GitHub](https://docs.github.com/en) is a cloud-based hosting service that lets you manage Git repositories.**

1. **In a repository, the main branch represents the primary, production-ready codebase, while the other branches allow for developent of features, bug fixes,or experiments without affecting th main line of code.**

1. **An IDE, Integrated Development Environment, is a software application that helps programmers develop, test, and debug software code efficiently.**

After you have successfully installed VS Code on your machine, do the following:-

1. Open your terminal and _move_ to your `SavvyCoders` directory
1. Type `code .` in the CLI and press 'Enter'

   > **NOTE**: `code .` launches VS Code (`code`) from the present directory (`.`)
1. Once VS Code has been opened, you might be prompted to install updates, go ahead and install these updates.

1. In VS Code, use the shortcut `"Ctrl + n"` to create a new file
1. Use the shortcut `"Ctrl + s"` to save the new file and give it a name: `practice.txt`
1. Add some text to `practice.txt` and save the file.
1. In your terminal, _list_ the contents of `SavvyCoders`. Look for `practice.txt`?
1. Preview the contents of the file in the terminal.
1. Development tools -- CLI, Git and GitHub, and VS Code
    *Set up Git in VS Code
    *Open a git repository
        *Clone a repository locally
        *Initialize a repository in a local folder
        *Publish local repository to GitHub
    *Open GitHub repository in a codespace
    *Open GitHub repository remotely
    *Stage and commitcode changes
        *Push and pull remote changes

1. Jupyter Notebook is a web-based application for the whole computation process:-- developing, documenting, executing code, and communicating of results.
    _We haven't went over JupyterNotebooks just yet._

1. Install Jupyter in VS Code
    *Add the following extensions by Microsoft
        *Jupyter
        *Jupyter Keymap
        *Jupyter Notebook Renderer
        *Jupyter Slide Show
        *Jupyter Cell Tags

1. Make sure you're in the correct directory, and typr "code." to open VS Code in that directory. Click the extensions

1. Use Jupyter in VS Code either intialize Jupyter Notebook from the VS Code internal console of simply create a new file with the ".ipynb" extension.

1. **Python is considered a HIGH LEVEL CODING  LANGUAGE.**
1. go to [Python](www.python.org/downloads/)
    *select your Python version
    *push button to download an installer
    *Run installer

1. Begin With foundational understanding of syntax and data types. Then practice simple programs and gradually move to more complex projects and libraries.
1. Set up your environment
    *Install python
Choose an IDE
    *Visual Studio Code
Install necessary packages
    *From the CLI, **install** necessary dependencies like... `Jupyter Notebook`, `NumPy`, `Matplotlib`, and `Pandas`.

   - pip install jupyter notebook
   - pip install numpy
   - pip install matplotlib
   - pip install pandas

1. Learn the basics
    *Syntax:
    *variables
    *data types
    *operators
    *control flow

1. Practice
    *start with simple programs
        *Hello World
        *basic calculations
        *input output
        *data structures

1. Explore Resources
    *Online Courses
    *Books
    *Youtube Channels
1. Some basics about debugging are:
    *run a debugger
    *employ a scientific outlook
    *debug after each section of new code
    *employ back tracking methods
    *perform binary searches
    *classify the bugs
    *use static code anlysis
